# Operationalizing Machine Learning
***
This project shows the code, images and results of an operationalizing project using Azure ML Studio, Azure SDK and Swagger.
## An overview of the project
***
This project first begins with uploading the dataset and using the AutoML function on Azure to generate the best model using a metric and ending criteria. The model is then deployed using Azure ACI to generate a swagger URI and REST API endpoint. The dataset used for this project is obtained from the direct marketing campaigns of a company which intends to predict whether a client will accept a term deposit or not. Using Azure and its workspace, this project looks at creating a cloud based machine learning model, from deployment to consumption and finally publication. Commands for the deployment, processing and endpoint results are executed using Git Bash. The image in the next section shows the steps and is followed by a description of the steps accompanied by useful figures.
